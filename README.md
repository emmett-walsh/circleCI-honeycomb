# Instrumenting CirclCI builds with honeycomb

I wanna experiment with getting traces from CI using Honeycomb's public orb.

## What I did

1. I signed up for a [free Honeycomb plan here](https://ui.honeycomb.io/signup?utm_source=product-trial-page&utm_medium=get-started-cta-self&utm_campaign=trial) (the sign up process ends on a page which shows you your API key)
2. I created this repo and activated the corresponding project in CirclCI
3. I added the honeycomb API key to the project Environment Variables
